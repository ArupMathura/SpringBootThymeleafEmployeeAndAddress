# Employee Address Management System


Description
-------------
The Employee Address Management System is a web-based application that allows an organization to manage the addresses of its employees. The system is built using the Spring Boot framework, which provides a robust and flexible platform for building web applications.

In this system, each employee can have multiple addresses associated with them, such as a home address, a work address, and a mailing address.
